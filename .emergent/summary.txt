<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to simplify and modernize the application's design to be more uniform and consistent with their main page (). The desired color palette is a modern, dark blue, with acrylic effects. The existing functionality, including authorization, must be preserved.

PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:
1.  **Services Page:**
    *   A page where the user can display their services for sale.
    *   Only the admin (the user) should be able to add/edit services.
    *   Each service should have: Name, Description, Price, Estimated Time, Payment Methods, and associated Frameworks.
    *   The UI should display a list of services, where each item can be expanded into a full card view with all details.
2.  **Contact Form:**
    *   A new page with a contact form.
    *   The form should include fields for: Name, Email, Phone (optional), Subject, and Message.
    *   Submissions should be sent to the user's email address.

**User's preferred language**: Russian. The next agent MUST respond in Russian.

**what currently exists?**
The application is a full-stack app with a redesigned dark-blue themed React frontend and a FastAPI backend.
- The backend API is fully functional for both Services and Contact features. SMTP for the contact form has been configured with user-provided Gmail credentials and tested successfully via .
- The  file has been updated with all necessary dependencies.
- The Services page frontend is complete. It successfully fetches and displays a list of services from the backend.
- The Contact page frontend has been built, but contains a bug preventing it from giving user feedback (success/error messages) or clearing the form after a successful submission.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working**: The agent was debugging the frontend of the Contact page (). Despite the backend API call succeeding (confirmed via  and ), the React component does not update its state to show a success message or clear the input fields after the form is submitted. The agent tried multiple fixes, including creating a frontend  file and restarting the service, but was unable to resolve the UI issue.
- **Status**: IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done**: Y (Agent used , , and . The bug was consistently reproduced.)
- **Which testing method agent to use?** . The previous agent was stuck in a loop trying to fix this. A fresh perspective from the troubleshooter is recommended before attempting further manual fixes.
- **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1 (P0):** Contact form UI does not update after submission.

**Issues Detail:**
- **Issue 1:**
    - **Description:** On the  page, after a user fills out and submits the form, the API call to the backend succeeds and an email is sent. However, the form fields are not cleared, and no success or error message is displayed to the user.
    - **Attempted fixes:**
        1.  Modified  to improve  handling.
        2.  Created  to ensure  was correctly set.
        3.  Restarted the frontend service to rule out hot-reloading issues.
        4.  Used , which confirmed the backend works but the frontend state management is failing.
    - **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  **Invoke **. The previous agent's attempts were unsuccessful, so a different approach is needed.
        2.  If manual debugging is attempted: Carefully review the  function in .
        3.  Pay close attention to the state update calls (, ) within the  block. Verify they are being called correctly and that the component is re-rendering as expected.
    - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** To complete the contact form feature by providing essential user feedback, making the form usable.
    - **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    - **Is recurring issue?** Y (within the last session)
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend (using  or ).

**In progress Task List**:
- None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **(P0)** Full end-to-end testing and verification by the user once the contact form UI is fixed.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Backend Fixes & Configuration:**
    - Configured  to send emails using the user's Gmail SMTP credentials. The  file was created for this.
    - Updated  to include all installed dependencies, ensuring a reproducible environment.
- **Feature Implementation:**
    - Implemented the full frontend functionality for the Services page in , including fetching and rendering service data from the API.
    - Implemented the initial UI for the Contact page in .
    - Created  to correctly configure the backend URL for API calls.
- **Testing & Administration:**
    - Promoted the user  to an administrator role for testing purposes.
    - Successfully tested the  endpoint via .
    - Used the  to validate the backend and identify the remaining frontend bug.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- None. The issues from the previous handoff (SMTP config, ) were resolved in this session.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend**: React, React Router, CSS, Axios
- **Backend**: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic, 
- **Database**: SQLite

**key DB schema**
- **Service**: 
- **User**: 

**changes in tech stack**
- None.

**All files of reference**
- **Created:**
    - : Stores SMTP credentials and other secrets for the backend.
    - : Stores  for the frontend.
- **Updated:**
    - : Regenerated to include all dependencies.
    - : Implemented the UI and data fetching.
    - : Implemented UI and submission logic (currently bugged).
    - : Ensured correct routing for new pages.
    - : Ensured correct navigation links.
    - : A script was run to modify a user's role to 'admin'.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- None.

**key api endpoints**
- : Submits the contact form. (Backend is working).
- : Fetches all services. (Working).
- Admin endpoints for services (, , ) are implemented.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **CRITICAL:** The user's preferred language is **Russian**. All communication must be in Russian.
- **Main Blocker:** The only remaining task is fixing the UI bug in . The backend is 100% functional.
- **Debugging History:** The previous agent was stuck on the  bug. Do not repeat the same steps (editing async/await, checking  files). The problem is likely subtle and related to React state management. **Using the  is highly recommended.**

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending user messages**
1.  User specified gmail as the SMTP provider. (Completed)
2.  User provided their Gmail credentials: , . (Completed and configured).

**Project Health Check:**
- **Broken**:
    - **Contact Page UI**: The form submission logic does not provide user feedback (e.g., clearing the form, showing a success message).
- **Mocked**:
    - The database contains 4 demo services for the Services page.

**3rd Party Integrations**:
- **fastapi-mail**: Now fully configured and functional for sending emails via the user's Gmail account.

**Testing status**
- **Testing agent used after significant changes**: YES (Used to identify the outstanding frontend bug).
- **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop**: NO (Recommended for the next agent).
- **Test files created**:  was updated.
- **Known regressions**: None.

**Credentials to test flow:**
- **Admin User**:  (password unknown, but the agent was able to elevate privileges directly in the database).
- **SMTP Credentials**: Stored in .

**What agent forgot to execute**
- The agent did not forget any tasks but was unable to complete the final bug fix for the contact form's UI.</analysis>
